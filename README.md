# node-webapiproducts

#### Building an API using node.js.

1. Creating a simple web server
2. Setting up routing to handle client requests
3. Pulling from JSON data file product information
4. Using HTML templates and replacing their placeholders
5. Creating an overview product page and indvidual product pages based on data parsed from JSON file.
6. Created my own module for a function. Exported that function from the module & imported it into the main module index.js file.
